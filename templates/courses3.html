            <p><strong>1. What Are Chess Tactics?</strong><br>
                Chess tactics are the dynamic maneuvers and sequences of moves that players use to gain a positional or material advantage. Unlike strategy, which involves long-term planning, tactics focus on immediate opportunities and threats on the board.</p>
